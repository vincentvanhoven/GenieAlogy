# GenieAlogy

**GenieAlogy** is a genealogy tool focused on ease-of-use. This is mostly accomplished by providing a visual interface
that displays the entire family tree you're working on as a node system. The nodes in this system can be
dragged-and-dropped freely to keep things neat.

## Features

This will be filled in with the first major release (<u>v1.0.0</u>).

## Technical specifications

This software is written in Go, Vue, and TypeScript, using the [Wails](https://wails.io) framework.

When working with the source code (not the released binaries), please note that Wails may require some minor [setup steps](https://wails.io/docs/gettingstarted/installation).

| Action                              | Command            |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------|
| Running a watcher (Go+Wails & Vite) | `wails dev`        |
| Running the tests                   | `go test -v ./...` |
| Building the binaries               | To be added later  |

## Development

Please note that this software is in active development, and stability is not a focus until the first major release
(<u>v1.0.0</u>).

You can find upcoming features/bugfixes on the [Planning board](https://github.com/users/vincentvanhoven/projects/2).
