# GenieAlogy

**GenieAlogy** is a genealogy tool focused on ease-of-use. This is mostly accomplished by providing a visual interface
that displays the entire family tree you're working on as a node system. The nodes in this system can be
dragged-and-dropped freely to keep things neat.

## Features

This will be filled in with the first major release (<u>v1.0.0</u>).

## Development

Please note that this software is in active development, and stability is not a focus until the first major release
(<u>v1.0.0</u>).

You can find upcoming features/bugfixes on the [Planning board](https://github.com/users/vincentvanhoven/projects/2).
